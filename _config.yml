  A recent Computer Science graduate who is changing career from healthcare to software engineering! 
  After being a Respiratory Therapist for ten years I realized that my job felt mundane, I no longer felt challenged. Everything a healthcare worker does is usually governed by
  protocols. Eventually those protocols become so routine it easy to go from situation to situation and it feels exactly the same. I decided I wanted to change careers and do something
  that challenges me. Software engineer has been the answer. I never coded anything so learning langauges and platforms proved to be a challenge. As challenging as it has been, I have 
  truly enjoyed it. I completed my online degree from Southern New Hampshire University. One thing I have taken away from online schooling is the dedication of learning and teaching yourself something
  is truly valuable. Please look around on my page at some of my projects!
