## My Java Zoo Monitoring Program
<br><br>
This project started out as a simple console program. The goal of the project was to learn Java and object oriented programming. I struggled with object oriented programming, specifically with creating and calling other classes. The first sample shows the final project which I recieved a C grade on. I couldn't accept that knowing how important object oriented programming was. After that semester I redeveloped the project to include classes that supported object oriented programming! I really wanted to learn to make graphical user interfaces within Java. I began taking the zoo program to that level as you can see in the examples below. Finally, I had a class the involved working with databases so I included a Sqllite database to store usernames, passwords and other information that may be needed!
<br><br>
Future Development:
  - Switch database to a MySql database

## Mobile App Development Android: Weight Loss App(Still in Development)
I took a class in App Development. The requirements for our final project was to make an app that utilized several screens and a database. I began creating the weight loss app. A user can create an account. Once they create an account they can enter a goal weight. Each day the user tracks their current weight which is saved to a database. On the main page there is a progress bar that shows the progress they have made to their goal weight. After submitting the project I recieved a "B". I wasn't completely satisfied with the app so I began redeveloping it. Please check back for updates!
<br><br>
Future Developments:
  - Change theme
  - Fix issues with reading from database
  - Change layout and constraints to make objects line up better
  - Fix some syntax errors
Current Bugs:
  - Sometimes the progress bar works other times it doesn't display
  - When the user loads the weight log from the database it sometimes crashes the app

### Raspberry and Python Temperature Monitoring Systems
One my class involved learning about IoT and embedded systems. We utilized the Grove Pi HAT along with various sesnors. Throughtout the semester we worked on various projects coding in Python. My final project was a temperature and humidity monitoring system. The temperature and humidity were displayed on the LCD screen. I coded the program to record every 30 minutes. The data was saved to a JSON file as well. My program contained conditional statements that would light one of three LED lights depending on certain temperature and humidity ranges. The device also used a light sensor since I only wanted the temperature and humidity to be recorded during daylight hours. After all the data was recorded I used CanvasJs to create a html chart to display the data that was recorded into the json file.
